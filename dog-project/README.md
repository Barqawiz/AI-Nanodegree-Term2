## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!


## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

	```
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
		cd dog-project
	```
2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/dogImages`.
3. Download the [human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/lfw`.  If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use [7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the folder.
4. Donwload the [VGG-16 bottleneck features](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) for the dog dataset.  Place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features`.
5. Obtain the necessary Python packages, and switch Keras backend to Tensorflow.  

	For __Mac/OSX__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-mac.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

	For __Linux__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-linux.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

	For __Windows__:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-windows.yml
		activate aind-dog
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
	```
6. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.

	```
		jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
	```

__NOTE:__ While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully answer all of the questions included in the notebook. __Unless requested, do not modify code that has already been included.__


## Amazon Web Services

Instead of training your model on a local CPU (or GPU), you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.
